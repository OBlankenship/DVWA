		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>Password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system.
			A common approach is to repeatedly try guesses for the password.</p>

		<p>Users often choose weak passwords. Examples of insecure choices include single words found in dictionaries, family names, any too short password
			(usually thought to be less than 6 or 7 characters), or predictable patterns
			(e.g. alternating vowels and consonants, which is known as leetspeak, so "password" becomes "p@55w0rd").</p>

		<p>Creating a targeted wordlists, which is generated towards the target, often gives the highest success rate. There are public tools out there that will create a dictionary
			based on a combination of company websites, personal social networks and other common information (such as birthdays or year of graduation).

		<p>A last resort is to try every possible password, known as a brute force attack. In theory, if there is no limit to the number of attempts, a brute force attack will always
			be successful since the rules for acceptable passwords must be publicly known; but as the length of the password increases, so does the number of possible passwords
			making the attack time longer.</p>

		<h3>Objective</h3>
		<p>Your goal is to get the administratorâ€™s password by brute forcing. Bonus points for getting the other four user passwords!</p>

		<br /><hr /><br />

		<h3>Vulnerable Level</h3>
		<p>The developer has completely missed out <u>any protections methods</u>, allowing for anyone to try as many times as they wish, to login to any user without any repercussions.</p>
